## Partition
- Use FM ALGORITHM to solve the problem of two-way min-cut 
partitioning.

## Floorplan
- Use the way which published in the DAC-86 paper entitled “A New Algorithm for Floorplan Design
- Solve the fixed-outline slicing floorplan design problem 
with a set of hard blocks

## Placement 
- Use the algorithm published in the ISPD-08 paper entitled “Abacus: fast legalization of standard cell 
circuits with minimal movement
